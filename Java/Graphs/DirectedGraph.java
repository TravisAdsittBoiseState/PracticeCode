/**
 * 
 * This is a Directed Graph class, there are no claims to efficiency here. It 
 * is capable of reading from an Adjacency Matrix textfile that is laid out in
 * a grid fashion with the delimiter ';' for example:
 * 
 *  ;A;B;C
 * A;-1;5;10
 * B;20;-1;2
 * C;10;5;-1
 * 
 * Will produce (if in debug mode):
 * 
 * Number of Nodes Found : 3
 *
 * Creating Nodes...
 * New Node Created! Node Name : A
 * New Node Created! Node Name : B
 * New Node Created! Node Name : C
 * 
 * Creating Edges...
 * New Edge Created! From Node : A To Node : B With Weight : 5
 * New Edge Created! From Node : A To Node : C With Weight : 10
 * New Edge Created! From Node : B To Node : A With Weight : 20
 * New Edge Created! From Node : B To Node : C With Weight : 2
 * New Edge Created! From Node : C To Node : A With Weight : 10
 * New Edge Created! From Node : C To Node : B With Weight : 5
 * 
 * This directed graph was created for the specific use of implementing 
 * Dijkstra's Algorithm, and the basic depth and breadth first searches. 
 * Though Dijksta'sAlgorithm is well known for its linear average run time, 
 * a little research shows that it is not useful for things such as 
 * "best route" for P2P road map searches on continent sized road maps.
