#8080 Intel Processor Emulation Project

This project is meant to help keep my C programming abilities sharp 
as well as learn more about processors and how software is layered
on top of them.

#Learned/Clarified

So far in doing this I have gotten more swift with my bit fiddling. 
It's difficult coming from an OOP environment to a situation where
there is no option but to have an insane series of switch case 
statements.

This is the first time I have taken apart a binary and disassembled
it using a disassembler that I have written. I can't imagine what
it would be like with some of the newer processors. I imagine that
it would be time effective to write other tools to analyze the 
assembly. There are tools out there I am sure.

#Final thoughts about the project

I have completed the opcode section of the emulator, when I get a 
chance I plan on implementing an input and output port that will
function with a console (i.e. keyboard input). 

The ultimate thing would be to put it on a raspberry pi and have
the input be the GPIO pins... We will see the Fall semester is
beggining in 10 days. 

Either way, despite having an understanding of how the rest of 
the project would be completed, sticking to it was difficult. 
It was a grind, but sticking to it was a good practice of 
completing a project. 

With that said I do not consider this complete, but it is an
emulator of a processor, you just cannot see or interact with 
it at this point haha.
