#8080 Intel Processor Emulation Project

This project is meant to help keep my C programming abilities sharp 
as well as learn more about processors and how software is layered
on top of them.

#Learned/Clarified

So far in doing this I have gotten more swift with my bit fiddling. 
It's difficult coming from an OOP environment to a situation where
there is no option but to have an insane series of switch case 
statements.

This is the first time I have taken apart a binary and disassembled
it using a disassembler that I have written. I can't imagine what
it would be like with some of the newer processors. I imagine that
it would be time effective to write other tools to analyze the 
assembly. There are tools out there I am sure.
